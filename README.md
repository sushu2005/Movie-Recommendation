# Movie-Recommendation
A simple movie recommendation system built using the MovieLens 100k dataset, powered by collaborative filtering and developed with Python, Flask, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap. This project recommends movies to users based on past user ratings and also allows searching for movie posters using the TMDB API.
